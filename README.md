This is a Selenium based Python Project Template.

It automates a SpeedTest using https://www.speedtest.net/, then captures the download & upload speed in a variable.
It then opens up your twitter account and creates a post stating your current download/upload vs. your paid download/upload.

Template can be modified to your liking.
